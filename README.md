Ever wonder how your phone camera captures those long panorama shots? In this project, we demonstrate the many algorithms necessary to build a composite image. Just to give you an idea of what goes into it: the camera needs to identify salient features, match them together across images, and then find the ideal transformations to overlap the images.
